# workspace
my java workspace 

(I don't know why github say there is 35% javascript, this is only java here).


This  is my java workspace made on eclipse, i put this workspace on my github to have more place on my laptop.

If you are a recruiter, you can see  all exercice i've made with eni ecole on java :) .

There is also a personal project like testbattle, I created this project to test object oriented programming.
